NAMD's public-keys
==================

This repository hosts all public keys of [NAMD](https://github.com/namd)'s
members.


Rules
-----

- Add **only one file per person** (if you have more than one key, please add
  one per line)
- The filename **must be** `your-github-username.pub` (in the root of
  repository)
- **DO NOT** use `\r` in your key file (we don't use Windows)
